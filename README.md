# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is my project0 file, it is a website about my hobbies, I love to draw, paint and 3d model, so I made a page on each one with a simple explination about the processes I use. I also designed a nice look to the site with my CSS file. I used various pusedo elements and CSS properties mixed with media queries and some SCSS elements to create a stylized look to the site. The home page gives basic information on each method of art that I do, Illustrations shows a few images and characters of mine, for paintings I used one I did in december to show how they differ from illustrations. I have a page called renders which shows some of the 3d renders I have made in Blender 3d.
