                I use Blender 2.8.1 to make 3d renders. Blender is a free 3d software program that allows anyone who tries the program to make 3d models and renders and animation of whatever they wish. For me this was my first time getting to use 3d software and it has been a fun journey and I have made some nice images and models with it.

                The first image is a render of the earth I made in following a tutorial, its a but stylized compared to the real earth. It was rendered using Cycles in blender, one of the render engines. The second umage is a simple render of Mt Fuji in Japan. Where I sculpted the mountain based on images and satilite photos and then extracted a UV map and painted it to match the real Fuji., the third is part of a house set I am making which shows a bathroom and outside uses an HDRI setting.

                If your image is very complex and you do not have enough ram in your computer, you might experience problems.
